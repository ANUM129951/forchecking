<p>Kashmir Solidarity Day is on February 5, and this day is observed by the people in Pakistan and Kashmir who have been fighting for their freedom for more than 70 years. This day is also celebrated in honor of the Kashmiris who have lost their lives in the fight for freedom <br>
</p>
<h4>HISTORY OF KASHMIR SOLIDARITY DAY</h4>
<p>The valley of Kashmir is known as ‘heaven on earth.’ Kashmir is one of the most popular tourist spots in Pakistan — it possesses exceptional beauty and is a place that must be visited at least once in your lifetime. Unfortunately, it has been riddled with territorial conflict since 1947. <br>
    From the partition of the subcontinent, the freedom of Kashmir has been an issue of conflict between India and Pakistan. The conflict between the two countries increases with every passing year. <br>
    Kashmir Solidarity Day is observed across Pakistan to portray solidarity with the Kashmiri people. Many freedom fighters have lost their loved ones in their struggle for a separate identity on the world’s map and Pakistan supports Kashmir in its primary right to self-determination. <br>
    Kashmir Solidarity Day was established by the opposition leader of Pakistan at the time, Nawaz Sharif, in 1990. Sharif called for a strike throughout Pakistan as a protest against the Indian army, which held some parts of Kashmir. He appealed to the nation to pray for Kashmir’s freedom</p>
