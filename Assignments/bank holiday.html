    <h1>Is 1 July 2023 a Public Holiday?</h1>
</head>

<body>
    <p>This is a holiday only for banks and bank employees. It is not a public holiday for the general population and businesses. Banks generally follow normal opening hours on 1st July bank holiday in Pakistan.


Every year, many other days are also announced as bank holidays in Pakistan. Banks remain closed on these days for the public, but not for employees who will have to report to work as usual. <br></p>
