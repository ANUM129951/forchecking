<h1> <b> <i> STATISTICS </i> </b> </h1>
<P><dfn>Basics of Statistics
</dfn>The basics of statistics include the measure of central tendency and the measure of dispersion. The central tendencies are mean, median and mode and dispersions comprise variance and standard deviation. <br>
Mean is the average of the observations. Median is the central value when observations are arranged in order. The mode determines the most frequent observations in a data set. <br>
Variation is the measure of spread out of the collection of data. Standard deviation is the measure of the dispersion of data from the mean. The square of standard deviation is equal to the variance. <br> <hr> </P>

<cite>In the case of descriptive statistics, the data or collection of data is described in summary. But in the case of inferential stats, it is used to explain the descriptive one. Both these types have been used on large scale.</cite>
<h3>DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS</h3>
<P>The data is <DEL> summarised </DEL> and explained in descriptive statistics. <DEL> The summarization is done from a population sample utilising several </DEL> factors such as mean and standard deviation. Descriptive statistics is a way of organising, representing, and explaining a set of data using charts, graphs, and summary measures. Histograms, pie charts, bars, and scatter plots are common ways to summarise data and present it in tables or graphs. Descriptive statistics are just that: descriptive. They donâ€™t need to be normalised beyond the data they collect.</P>
<H3>INFERENTIAL STATISTICS</H3>
<P> <blockquote>We attempt to interpret the meaning of descriptive statistics using inferential statistics. We utilise inferential statistics to convey the meaning of the collected data after it has been collected, evaluated, and summarised. The probability principle is used in inferential statistics to determine if patterns found in a study sample may be extrapolated to the wider population from which the sample was drawn. Inferential statistics are used to test hypotheses and study correlations between variables, and they can also be used to predict population sizes. Inferential statistics are used to derive conclusions and inferences from samples, i.e. to create accurate generalisations.</blockquote>
