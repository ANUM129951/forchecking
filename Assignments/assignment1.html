<h1>STATISTICS</h1>

<body>
    <h4>Defination</h4>
    <pre><p>statistics, the science of collecting, analyzing, presenting, and interpreting data. Governmental needs for census data as well as information about a variety of economic activities provided much of the early impetus for the field of statistics. Currently the need to turn the large amounts of data
         available in many applied fields into useful information has stimulated both theoretical and practical developments in statistics</p></pre>

    <p>There are two type of statistics</p>
    <ul><li>Descriptive statistics</li>
    <li>Inferential statistics</li></ul>

<h2>DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS</h2>    
<P>Descriptive statistics are tabular, graphical, and numerical summaries of data. The purpose of descriptive statistics is to facilitate the presentation and interpretation of data. Most of the statistical presentations appearing in newspapers and magazines are descriptive in nature. Univariate methods of descriptive statistics use data to enhance the understanding of a single variable; multivariate methods focus on using statistics to understand the relationships among two or more variables. To illustrate methods of descriptive statistics, the previous example in which data were collected on the age, gender, marital status, and annual income of 100 individuals will be examined.</P>
<h3>TABULAR METHODS</h3>
<P>The most commonly used tabular summary of data for a single variable is a frequency distribution. A frequency distribution shows the number of data values in each of several nonoverlapping classes. Another tabular summary, called a relative frequency distribution, shows the fraction, or percentage, of data values in each class. The most common tabular summary of data for two variables is a cross tabulation, a two-variable analogue of a frequency distribution</P>
<h3>GRAPHICAL METHODS</h3>
<P>A number of graphical methods are available for describing data. A bar graph is a graphical device for depicting qualitative data that have been summarized in a frequency distribution. Labels for the categories of the qualitative variable are shown on the horizontal axis of the graph. A bar above each label is constructed such that the height of each bar is proportional to the number of data values in the category. A bar graph of the marital status for the 100 individuals in the above example is shown in Figure 1. There are 4 bars in the graph, one for each class. A pie chart is another graphical device for summarizing qualitative data. The size of each slice of the pie is proportional to the number of data values in the corresponding class. </P>
<H3>NUMERICAL MEASURES</H3>
<P>A variety of numerical measures are used to summarize data. The proportion, or percentage, of data values in each category is the primary numerical measure for qualitative data. The mean, median, mode, percentiles, range, variance, and standard deviation are the most commonly used numerical measures for quantitative data. The mean, often called the average, is computed by adding all the data values for a variable and dividing the sum by the number of data values. The mean is a measure of the central location for the data. The median is another measure of central location that, unlike the mean, is not affected by extremely large or extremely small data values. When determining the median, the data values are first ranked in order from the smallest value to the largest value. If there is an odd number of data values, the median is the middle value; if there is an even number of data values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The third measure of central tendency is the mode, the data value that occurs with greatest frequency.

    Percentiles provide an indication of how the data values are spread over the interval from the smallest value to the largest value. Approximately p percent of the data values fall below the pth percentile, and roughly 100 − p percent of the data values are above the pth percentile. Percentiles are reported, for example, on most standardized tests. Quartiles divide the data values into four parts; the first quartile is the 25th percentile, the second quartile is the 50th percentile (also the median), and the third quartile is the 75th percentile.
    
    The range, the difference between the largest value and the smallest value, is the simplest measure of variability in the data. The range is determined by only the two extreme data values. The variance (s2) and the standard deviation (s), on the other hand, are measures of variability that are based on all the data and are more commonly used. Equation 1 shows the formula for computing the variance of a sample consisting of n items. In applying equation 1, the deviation (difference) of each data value from the sample mean is computed and squared. The squared deviations are then summed and divided by n − 1 to provide the sample variance.
    Equation.
    
    
    The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Because the unit of measure for the standard deviation is the same as the unit of measure for the data, many individuals prefer to use the standard deviation as the descriptive measure of vaRIABLE
